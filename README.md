## Philosophy

Like the alchemists of old who sought to transform base metals into gold, AIchemist aims to refine and combine AI building blocks into powerful, practical solutions. Each component is crafted to be:

- **Composable** - Works well independently and in combination
- **Documented** - Clear purpose and usage instructions
- **Practical** - Solves real problems in daily workflows
